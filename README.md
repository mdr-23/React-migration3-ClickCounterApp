# Click Counter App

This is a simple Click Counter app built using jQuery and HTML. It allows the user to increment a counter value by clicking a button.

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, you can simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The counter starts at 0 and each time the "Increment" button is clicked, the counter value increases by 1.

## Technologies Used

- jQuery: The jQuery library is used to handle the click event and update the counter value in real-time.

## Code Explanation

The main logic of the app is contained within the following JavaScript code:

```javascript
$(document).ready(function() {
  let count = 0;
  
  $('.btn').click(function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    count++;
    $('.counter').text(count);
  });
});
